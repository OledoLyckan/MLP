    "In all previous notebooks we worked on, we needed to explicitly set the figure size, axis font size, and other parameters to ensure consistent and clear visualizations. To streamline this process, I've created a utility function that automatically configures these settings for you. This function is located in the `./utils/notebook_config.py` file within the parent directory. When these settings are defined in the `notebook_config.py` file, you can simply call the function at the beginning of your notebook to apply them throughout your visualizations. In general, it's a good practice to encapsulate such configurations in a utility function to promote code *reusability* and *maintainability*.\n",

    "1. *Initialize*: Start with an initial guess for model weights (parameters or coefficients).\n",
    "2. *Compute predictions*: Use current parameters to calculate predicted values.\n",
    "3. *Calculate cost*: Compute the cost using MSE.\n",
    "4. *Compute gradients*: Calculate gradients of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "5. *Update parameters*: Adjust parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient using a small learning rate.\n",
