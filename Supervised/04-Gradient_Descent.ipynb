    "In this lab, you will write your own Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and try it out on different datasets. We will start with the basic version, the Batch GD, and then take a look at how Stochastic GD (SGD) works. You will also see why feature scaling matters by testing an example where the SGD algorithm struggles without scaling.\n",

    "In all previous notebooks we worked on, we needed to explicitly set the figure size, axis font size, and other parameters to ensure consistent and clear visualizations. To streamline this process, I've created a utility function that automatically configures these settings for you. This function is located in the `./utils/notebook_config.py` file within the parent directory. When these settings are defined in the `notebook_config.py` file, you can simply call the function at the beginning of your notebook to apply them throughout your visualizations. In general, it's a good practice to encapsulate such configurations in a utility function to promote code *reusability* and *maintainability*.\n",

    "\n",
    "GD follows these steps:\n",
    "1. *Initialize*: Start with an initial guess for model weights (parameters or coefficients).\n",
    "2. *Compute predictions*: Use current parameters to calculate predicted values.\n",
    "3. *Calculate cost*: Compute the cost using MSE.\n",
    "4. *Compute gradients*: Calculate gradients of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\n",
    "5. *Update parameters*: Adjust parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient using a small learning rate.\n",
    "6. *Iterate*: Repeat until the solution converges or a set number of iterations is reached.\n",

Use the results of your error metrics and plots to justify your conclusions. Do not spend too much time on the graphics or animating the results. Your focus should be on the correctness of your algorithm implementation, and data analysis.\n",
