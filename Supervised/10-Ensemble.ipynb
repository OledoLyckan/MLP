    "# Ensemble Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble learning is a powerful ML technique that enhances the performance of predictive models by combining the predictions of multiple base learners (weak learners). Instead of relying on just one strong model, we use a group of \"base/weak learners\" and blend their answers. This usually gives us more accurate and reliable results because the strengths of one model can help make up for the weaknesses of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will go over the main ideas behind ensemble learning that we talked about in class, plus introduce a few new Ada-based models we did not cover or discuss. By the end, you will have an understanding of how these methods work and how they can be used in real-world ML projects. Some of these models, as I explained, are very popular in training ML models.\n",

    "- In the code section below, we have a function that generates a dataset for classification, simulating a real-world scenario with multiple features. All generated features are made as `informative`, meaning they directly contribute to the class labels. The non-informative features (also called \"noise\" or \"redundant\" features) do not contribute to the class labels. Here, we want all features to be informative, therefore, `n_informative` is set to the total number of features. You can read about it in the SciKit-Learn documentation on `make_classification()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another new aspect of the developed function below is error handling in the function using `assert`. The `assert` statements in the function act as guardrails, ensuring that the input parameters meet necessary preconditions for the function to operate correctly. It is a good practice to use `assert` in your codes and to evaluate the input parameters."

    "\n",
    "Of course we can! Before that, lets recap the techniques we can use to improve our model's performance: Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you forgot, cross validation is a fundamental technique for evaluating and improving the generalizability of ML models. It plays a key role in ensuring that your model performs well not just on the training data, but also on new data. For classification problems using `StratifiedKFold` is highly recommended, especially when the dataset has imbalanced classes. See your earlier lecture notes or check out [this link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameters are settings that define how a model operates, such as the maximum depth of a decision tree, the number of estimators in an ensemble method, or the learning rate for gradient boosting. Choosing the right combination of hyperparameters can significantly impact a model's accuracy, stability, and overall effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than relying on default settings or trial-and-error, hyperparameter tuning systematically searches for the optimal configuration. One popular method for this task is `GridSearch`, which combines the power of exhaustive search and cross-validation. `GridSearch` works by defining a \"grid\" of hyperparameter values you want to test. For each combination in the grid, the model is trained and validated using cross-validation (e.g., StratifiedKFold). By evaluating performance across all combinations, `GridSearchCV` identifies the hyperparameter settings that provide the best results based on the chosen metric, such as accuracy, precision, or mean squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning is a cornerstone of **modern machine learning workflows (pipelines)**. Together, these techniques make sure that your model is not only well evaluated but also fine tuned for optimal performance. By investing time in these steps, you can build models that generalize well to new data, avoiding pitfalls like overfitting or underfitting and achieving better results across the board.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ NOTE:\n",
    "**You need to perform cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve your model's performance for your FINAL, practical project. Write it down in your to-do list, and remember it, not only for your project, but for any future machine learning tasks you work on.**\n",

    "In the code section below, I have developed the modified version of `ClassifierComparison` class, named `ClassifierComparisonOpt`, as optimizer. This class integrates both cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to give a more accurate and fair comparison across popular classifiers like Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and others. I intentionally opt out LightGBM and CatBoost to reduce the execution time, and I recommend not to include them in this lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our new class automatically scales features, runs grid search over predefined hyperparameter ranges using k-fold cross-validation, and evaluates the best model on a hold-out test set. This ensures that each model is tuned and validated properly before comparing their accuracy, precision, F1 score, confusion matrices, and decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, focus on `get_models_with_params` function developed in `ClassifierComparisonOpt` class. The function defines a dictionary of popular classifiers paired with their respective hyperparameter grids (perhaps not all hyperparameters in that model, but rather the most important ones). Each entry consists of a model instance and a dictionary specifying the range of values to explore for key hyperparameters like `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, or `min_samples_split`. This setup allows the class to systematically apply grid search using `GridSearchCV` to each model, verify that every algorithm is tuned over a meaningful range of settings for fair and optimized comparison.\n",

    "## Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelization in ML allows multiple computations to run simultaneously, significantly speeding up training and evaluation, especially when working with many classifiers or large datasets. Some classifiers like `Random Forest`, `Bagging`, and `Gradient Boosting` natively support parallel training by setting the `n_jobs` parameter. If `n_jobs=k` then computations are partitioned into `k` parallel jobs, and run on k CPU cores of the machine. If `n_jobs=-1` then all cores available on the machine are used. Note that because of inter-process communication overhead, the speedup might not be linear (i.e., using k jobs will unfortunately not be k times as fast). Significant speedup can still be achieved though when building a large number of trees, or when building a single tree requires a fair amount of time (e.g., on large datasets). When tuning hyperparameters across multiple models, `GridSearchCV` also supports parallelization with `n_jobs=-1`, allowing it to train and evaluate multiple parameter combinations at once. You can see the `n_jobs` settings in the `ClassifierComparisonOpt` class we developed above."
